# Hogweed_detection
Overview

Plant invasions pose severe threats to biodiversity, human health, and economies worldwide. Heracleum mantegazzianum, commonly known as Giant Hogweed, was introduced to Europe as an ornamental plant in the 19th century and has since become a problematic invasive species. Besides outcompeting native flora, Giant Hogweed poses significant health risks to humans through its toxic sap.

This project aims to enhance the detection and management of Giant Hogweed by integrating cutting-edge tools such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and vision transformers (ViT) with high-resolution images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Leveraging AI algorithms, these methods achieve impressive accuracy, with mAP scores of 0.68 and 0.60 respectively, in identifying Giant Hogweed infestations.
